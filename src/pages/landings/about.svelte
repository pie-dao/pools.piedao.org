      Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are a core component of the traditional finance world, and our community has been able to bring this essential financial tool to the world of DeFi thanks to the latest Ethereum smart contract developments.

    <h1 class="mt-4">Vision</h1>
    <div class="font-thin mt-4">
        At PieDAO, we believe that the future of finance is passive and permission-less.
        <br/><br/>
        With this in mind, we are working to solve existing problems by democratizing access to top-quality passive investment strategies, building products that make DeFi easy and keep users safe.
        <br/><br/>
        Our vision is to spread risk-minimized and accessible DeFi adoption, with our indices serving as a vital piece of the decentralized finance puzzle. 
        <br/><br/>
        As our community and offerings grow we are bringing DeFi projects together, building bridges and strong links. PieDAO will become a vibrant hub where DeFi users can come together to learn, connect, and vote in governance proposals across DeFi projects.
        <br/><br/>
        This breaking development known as metagovernance is currently under audit, and will allow the DAO to be delegated the underlying assets in our products. Metagovernance simplifies decentralized governance with users just needing DOUGH to participate across the ecosystem, massively increasing voter participation.
        <br/><br/>
        DeFi is radically changing the world of finance, and our ambition is to be at the forefront of this movement, leading with strong values, safe and easy adoption, and engaged governance participation.
        <br/><br/>
        Join us on our journey.

    <h1 class="font-lg mt-4">Why are ETFs and Indices so important?</h1>
    <div class="font-thin mt-4">
        Indices are baskets of tokens allowing a user to easily gain exposure to a broad range of assets with just one transaction. Alongside convenience our DeFi index offerings provide risk-minimised exposure to the rapidly expanding decentralized finance ecosystem. Holding a diverse basket of assets reduces your exposure to any single underperforming token and minimises the damage of potential black swan events.
        <br/><br/>
        We don’t just provide DeFi products. Our BTC and USD indices contain multiple different tokens, enabling users to gain safe exposure to these assets without relying on any one service provider. Holders of these pies will experience minimal loss in the event that any one token loses its peg.
        <br/><br/>
        As well as safety, there are also huge opportunities for those who chose to get involved. Many of our pies can be staked, a process where holders provide liquidity in exchange for a steady stream of rewards.
    </div>

    <h1 class="mt-4">What is a DAO?</h1>
    <div class="font-thin mt-4">
        DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. We are a community with no leaders and a common belief in power sharing and decentralization. 
        <br/><br/>
        PieDAO revolves around DOUGH, our community governance token. Holding DOUGH gives you a voice in everything we do, as well as a share of the fees our products generate. Anybody can submit a Pie Improvement Proposal on our forum and kickstart a discussion. If your proposal gains traction it will move through a voting process. First DOUGH holders are able to signal support via Snapshot, moving to a formal vote made through our Aragon governance interface.
