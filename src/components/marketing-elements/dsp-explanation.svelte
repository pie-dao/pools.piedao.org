        Don’t sleep on the underdog. DEFI+S gives exposure to lower marketcap projects that have incredible potential for future growth.

    <h1 class="mt-4">Objective:</h1>
    <div class="font-thin">
        Researching low cap projects is a time-intensive, high-risk, high-reward process. As a community of closely connected DeFi users we were able to leverage our understanding of this emerging segment of the DeFi industry. We came to a clear consensus on exactly which projects have the most potential and are tackling the most important issues. DEFI+S is the result of our efforts.

    <h1 class="mt-4">Methodology:</h1>

    <div class="font-thin">
        DEFI+S is built using a clearly defined weight-focused methodology. Those assets with a larger market cap are given a larger representation in the pie, ensuring that the low market cap projects with limited liquidity do not prevent the pie from reaching its maximum potential. This is especially important when dealing with low market cap projects.

    <h1 class="mt-4">Operation:</h1>

    <div class="font-thin">
        DEFI+S is a tokenized representation of the most promising projects in the space. When a user mints DEFI+S our contract purchases the underlying assets from Uniswap and other providers, sending the tokens to our treasury. Users can also mint the tokens directly with their wallet if they hold all the required tokens. In this way DEFI+S tokens are fully backed, and can be redeemed at any time at the press of a button.

        The index is built using Balancer smart pools, which constantly rebalance and react to market changes in real-time. There is no withdrawal fee, and a highly competitive 0.7% streaming fee rewards DOUGH holders for their governance of the system.
