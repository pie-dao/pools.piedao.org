    <h1 class="font-lg">Summary:</h1>
    <span class="font-thin">
        Blue chips only. DEFI+L represents DeFi’s biggest and best. Like all our pies DEFI+L actively rebalances, constantly locking in profits as market prices fluctuate. These large cap DeFi projects manage billions of dollars of assets and provide a wide range of financial tools, from synthetic derivatives to decentralized loans.
    </span>

    <h1 class="mt-4">Objective:</h1>
    <div class="font-thin">
        With DEFI+L we wanted to give users easy exposure to the biggest DeFi projects at the top of their game. Although there are never guarantees in this industry these projects represent the most established, respected and valued assets in the space.
        <br/><br/>
        If you’re looking to bet on DeFi’s boldest, this is the pie for you.
    </div>

    <h1 class="mt-4">Methodology:</h1>

    <div class="font-thin">
        Our community came to consensus that these projects are the clear leaders in DeFi. Whether the metric is marketcap, volume, assets under management or recognition, these projects lead the pack.
        <br/><br/>
        Allocation is determined using a strict methodology, with percentage share proportional to the market cap of each project weighted through the computation of a Sentiment Score assessing each project’s innovation, functionality to the DeFi ecosystem & growth potential. This robust procedure allows our pies to scale to the largest possible size, without smaller projects with less liquidity limiting potential growth.

    <h1 class="mt-4">Operation:</h1>

    <div class="font-thin">
      DEFI+L is a tokenized representation of the seven biggest projects in DeFi. When a user mints DEFI+L our contract either purchases the underlying assets from Uniswap and other decentralized providers or uses tokens available in the user’s wallet, sending them to our treasury. In this way DEFI+L tokens are fully backed by reserves, redeemable at any time at the press of a button.
      <br/><br/>
      DeFi+L has been upgraded from a Balancer Smart Pool to a PieVault, benefitting from a more secure architecture than traditional AMM based ETF products. Unlike AMMs that rebalance constantly, PieVaults allow flexibility in the allocation, enabling holders to benefit from upward price movements without ‘selling the winners’ and buying the losers. Rebalancing can be called by anyone at any time via governance.
      <br/><br/>
      PieVaults allow for interaction with smart-contracts, allowing the assets to be used productively across DeFi and generate passive income.
      <br/><br/>
      Just like other PieVaults YPIE, PLAY and USD++, DeFi+L will enable meta-governance, with DOUGH holders able to vote using the underlying assets in their respective protocol decisions.
      <br/><br/>
      It’s also possible to stake DEFI+L in our DEFI+L / ETH pool. Users are able to provide liquidity in return for a steady stream of DOUGH. This pool enables an efficient market for other users to easily swap in and out of the DEFI+L token.
