    <h1 class="font-lg">Summary:</h1>
    <span class="font-thin">
        A collaboration between the PieDAO and NFTX communities, PLAY is an Ethereum gaming, NFT and metaverse powerhouse. Thanks to NFTX’s NFT funds PLAY provides direct exposure to ERC-721 NFTS alongside the most promising platforms for Ethereum game developers, builders, players, and creators.

    <h1 class="mt-4">Objective:</h1>
    <div class="font-thin">
        Ethereum is revolutionising the gaming industry by providing open marketplaces and direct ownership of digital goods. This emergent industry is rapidly accelerating, and PLAY seeks to provide exposure to the standout games and platforms for builders and the digital creator economy. Not only that, PLAY seeks to capture the key players in the nascent metaverse.
        <br/><br/>
        The metaverse thesis holds that as more and more of our lives, including not just recreation, but creativity, work, and identity itself transition to the digital realm, decentralized technology has a vital role to play in forming the backbone infrastructure. 
        <br/><br/>
        Our community are firm believers in the Metaverse and so PLAY contains the market leaders shaping this interconnected digital world.
        <br/><br/>
        NFTs are a core pillar of the technical innovation driving this new market. Working with NFTX we were able to include direct exposure to NFT indices themselves

    <h1 class="mt-4">Methodology:</h1>

    <div class="font-thin">
        Once we had reached consensus on the core assets to best represent this ecosystem we applied our established market-cap derived methodology.<br/><br/>    
        Computing the 30 day market cap we weighted PLAY accordingly, giving a larger share to more established assets. This robust procedure allows our pies to scale to the largest possible size, without smaller projects with less liquidity limiting potential growth. A sentiment score assessing each project’s innovation, community ecosystem & growth potential provided micro-adjustments to this benchmark.    </div>

    
    <h1 class="mt-4">Operation:</h1>
    <div class="font-thin">
        PLAY is a PieVault, benefitting from a more secure architecture than traditional AMM based ETF products. Unlike AMMs that rebalance constantly, PieVaults allow flexibility in the allocation, enabling holders to benefit from upward price movements without ‘selling the winners’ and buying the losers. Rebalancing can be called by anyone at any time via governance.        <br/><br/>
        PieVaults allow for interaction with smart-contracts, allowing the assets to be used productively across DeFi.
        <br/><br/>
        Just like existing PieVaults YPIE and DEFI+L, PLAY will enable meta-governance, with DOUGH holders able to vote using the underlying assets in their respective protocol decisions.    </div>
        <br/><br/>
        Active strategies are also possible, including staking and lending with the PieVault bouncing between strategies as yields change to maintain the highest possible return for holders. PLAY holders passively benefit from this intrinsic productivity, without having to perform any action themselves.
        <br/><br/>
        More strategies will be activated over time as they become available.
